\section{Abstract}
This short report recapitulates the working and programming with the robot in the lab \emph{Introduction to Autonomous and Intelligent Systems} in summer semester 2014. Each chapter describes one of the six key aspects of this project by means of motivation, approach and occurred problems. This key aspects are
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Color detection
	\item Beacon detection
	\item Self-localization and orientation
	\item Motion control
	\item Caging a Ball
	\item Obstacle avoidance (optional)
\end{enumerate}

\section{Color Detection}
Implementation mainly done by Daniel Eberharter.\\
Further development through Stefan Haselwanter and Claudio Canella.

\subsection{Motivation}
The robot is placed into an enviroment, which is bordered by a total of eight beacons. These beacons consists of a combination of two colored strips (here \emph{white}, \emph{blue}, \emph{red}, and \emph{yellow}) placed horizontal around the beacon. Each of the beacons has a unique combination of these colors (swapping top and bottom color results in a different combination).
For localizing itself the robot needs to find at least two of these beacons - therefore it has to detect and interpret the colors.

\subsection{Approach}
For color detection we convert the RGBA-image of the phone camera to HSV\footnote{Hue Saturation Value} color space. The big advantage of HSV in comparison to RGB color space is the linear mapping of the colors. This behaviour allows to detect a single color by adding tolerances $t$ to the HSV-values\footnote{In the following $c_{hue}$ is the hue of HSV-color $c$. The same holds respective for $c_{sat}$ as saturation, and $c_{val}$ as value} $c$, and check if the pixel color $p$ lies within the bounds of 

\[c_{hue} - t \le p_{hue} \le c_{hue} + t\]
\[c_{sat} - t \le p_{sat} \le c_{sat} + t\]
\[c_{val} - t \le p_{val} \le c_{val} + t\]\\
After the \emph{inRange} function call\cite{opencv_man_arrays} the result image will be a binary matrix with all pixels within the color range being mapped to 1 and all others to 0. The OpenCV function \emph{findContours}\cite{opencv_man_struct_analysis} in combination with \emph{boundingRect}\cite{opencv_man_struct_analysis} returns a rectangle object for each contour\footnote{def. contour: the outline of a figure or body; the edge or line that defines or bounds a shape or object\cite{dict_contour}} in the image. Additionally we have to set a minimum size of these rectangles and discard the smaller ones, because really small rectangles tend to be irrelevant objects (that just happens to match the beacon colors) or errors in detection.
The only relevant information for storing are these rectangles and the associated colors. 

\subsection{Advantages of using \emph{inRange}-Color-Mapping}
The biggest advantage by far is the improved frame rate. When using Histogram-based color detection we encountered severe latency problems (leading to a maximum frame rate of $\frac{1}{4}$ fps), which made our robot inoperable. This malfunction arises with the usage of the OpenCV backprojection functions, which basically takes the target's color-probability and creates a binary image out of the camera frame with only displaying objects that would map this probability.

Additionally \emph{inRange} based color detection is more resilent against environmental influence such as glare or the JavaCamera's automatic white-balancing (which turned out to be very obnoxious).

\subsection{Additional Features}
For each of the beacon relevant colors, default HSV-color values are hard coded. In perfect conditions (no glare, no shadows, etc.) these default values hold very well, unfortunately the requirements were mostly not met in the lab. Therefore additional color calibration was implemented to match the needed color values to real-world conditions and to avoid misinterpretation of colors.


\section{Beacon Detection}
Implementation mainly done by Daniel Eberharter. \\
Further development through Stefan Haselwanter and Claudio Canella.

\subsection{Motivation}
The detection of beacons is vital for the used localization algorithm (see chapter \ref{sec:localization}), therefore it is necessary to determine if a object is a beacon or not with a high confidence.

\subsection{Approach}
First of we define a set of beacons we use as constants, with the contained information being the upper- and lower-color and the respective coordinates on the testfield. To conclude that two rectangles (returned by the colortracking algorithm) belong to a beacon we have to check wether these rectangles are in near proximity\footnote{Meaning that the lower edge of the upper rectangle is within the tolerance bounds of the upper edge of the lower rectangle}, with keeping in mind that the order of upper and lower color is not interchangable. 
As there is the possibility that the bounding rectangles do not touch each other based on the fact that the lighting is semi-optimal\footnote{With optimal lighting being a lightsouce, that hits the object with the same light intensity from each direction and therefore casts no shadow.}, we have added a tolerance parameter which loosens the bounds between the two rectangles.

\subsection{Problems}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The problem we had with beacon detection was that we detected many colors in the background that interfere with our beacons. This was partially solved by thresholding the rectangle size.
		\item White proved to be an unfortunate color for beacon detection, as walls tend to be white and they can't be ignored by size thresholding. That is why we decided to discard white as a valid beacon color. Unfortunately this means that we can no longer use the beacons at position ($X_{min}$,$\frac{Y_{max}}{2}$) and ($X_{max}$,$\frac{Y_{max}}{2}$), but also reduces the probability of wrongly detected beacons and therefore increases the overall precision.
	\end{itemize}


\section{Self-Localization \& Orientation -\\ Canella, Haselwanter}
\label{sec:localization}
Implementation mainly done by Claudio Canella and Stefan Haselwanter. \\
Further development through Daniel Eberharter and Christoph Haas.

\subsection{Motivation}
The self-localization and orientation of the robot is quite important because the robot has to determine where it is in the world space to apply further movements or other commands (see chapter \ref{sec:motion} and \ref{sec:caging}).

\subsection{Approach - Self-Localization}
For self-localization we use 2 beacons and simple trigonometry (\emph{law of \mbox{cosine}/\ sine} and \emph{Pythagorean theorem}) to calculate the robot position. We found this theorems easier to implement and understand as circle intersection, especially as we know the distance to the beacons and the distance between them. After we calculate our distance from the left (x-axis) and the top beacon (y-axis) we have to differentiate several cases depending on the detected beacons to get the correct position.

\subsection{Approach - Orientation}
For the orientation we also use trigonometry. We assume the center of the camera's screen as a reference point for the robot's field of view. If we detect one beacon we can determine the angle (and thus the orientation of the robot) in which the robot is located in world space using the robot's position, the position of the detected beacon, the distance to the beacon and simple sine/cosine arithmetic.

\subsection{Problems}
At first we tried to implement self-localization using circle intersection, but somehow ran into problems as the function always returned either \emph{NaN} or $\pm \infty$. So instead of wasting too much time trying to fix it we decided to switch to trigonometry which worked almost right away and is also a little bit faster.

\section{Usage of program}
The usage of the program depends on what the robot should do, but some steps are the same. Therefore we first discuss the steps that have to be done for all actions then the steps for each case.\\\\
\emph{Basic Steps}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Calc Homography:} If this takes quite some time, then the homography matrix could not be calculated, so please try again.
		\item \textbf{Calibrate Colors:} Name of color to be selected is displayed on the screen, aim with the crosshair at the correct color and touch the screen.
		\item \textbf{Calibrate Robot:} Put the green ball in front of the robot (10-15cm) so that it is centered on the screen. The robot will then perform turns and forward-backward movement to calculate a movement- and turn-factor for the robots servos.\\
	\end{enumerate}
\emph{Move to coordinates steps}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Move to...:} Specify coordinates in the format [x:y]
		\item \textbf{Toggle Tracking}\\
	\end{enumerate}
\emph{Caging a ball steps}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Toggle catch object}
	\end{enumerate}
